[Benchmarks](https://marcelm.github.io/dnaio-asv/) for [dnaio](https://github.com/marcelm/dnaio) using [airspeed velocity](http://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv/)

The benchmarks are currently run manually on a rented virtual machine somewhere on the internet,
so the measurements are not as reliable as they would be on a dedicated machine.
